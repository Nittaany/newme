            <h2>GRADUATIONS</h2>
            <p>Thinking about those Primary years, will always put a smile on my face. 
                It was like a journey to get admission to this as a young kid who doesn't know how to even hold a pencil 
                & leaving it with my height almost equal to teachers.
                I completed my schooling from<a href="https://www.facebook.com/pages/category/School/New-English-Secondary-Boarding-School-1589428104498181/">
                <strong>New English Secondary Boarding School</strong></a></p>

            <p>Well, If I come down to the memories I cherish,
                My first memory of High School was fear, 
                but never thought that would become so dear, 
                everything went very well academically and socially eventhough I did many mistakes,  
                It taught me valuable lessons which always will remain unforgettable. As every step of the journey is a destination in itself, 
                I Graduated with <em>Science</em> form <a href="https://www.trinity.edu.np/">
                <strong>Trinity International College</strong></a></p>
            <p>In the journey of life, I believe every step is a destination itself like where all these destinies are in those different beautiful books on a bookshelf. 
            After high school, it was time to pick another interesting book from the shelf and walk through it's pages of journey (<em>Me & Computers</em>).

            <h2>CODING</h2>
            <p>I am very keen on COMPUTERS.</p>
            <p>As a beginner on this journey, I chose PYTHON and  
                I've almost learnt the basics and this whole credit goes to the beautifully designed course by <a href="https://youtu.be/XKHEtdqhLK8">THE BRO CODE.</a> 
                Besides this, I'm also good at C & C++. 
            </p>
            <p class="Mini-prj">I had prepared few mini-projects while I was hanging around with the Learnings:
            <ul class="Mini-prj">
                <li class="Mini-prj">Rock Paper & Scissors</li>
                <li class="Mini-prj">Know ME? QUIZ</li>
            </ul></p>
            <p>‚ÄúWhen I write codes, only God and I understood what it is. Now only God knows.‚Äù </p>

            <h2>WEB DESIGNING & DEVELOPING </h2>
        
            <P>Besides Coding, I've come across one of the essentials of the Internet "Web Development",
            Essential in the way that everything is now on the internet and with this, 
            we are only able to achieve this vast ocean of INTERNET.
            </P>
            <p>I have managed to get Knowledge of:</p>
                <ul>
